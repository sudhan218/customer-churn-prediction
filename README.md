# Customer Churn Prediction

**"Predict churn before it happens ‚Äî keep your customers, boost your business."**

---

## üìå Overview
This project aims to **predict customer churn** using machine learning by analyzing historical customer data, including demographics, service usage patterns, and account information.  

The primary goal is to **identify customers at high risk of leaving** so that businesses can take **proactive retention measures**, reduce churn, and improve overall customer satisfaction.  

The solution covers:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and optimization
- Model evaluation with business-relevant metrics
- Prediction for new customer data

## üìä Dataset
The project uses a **Customer Churn dataset** (such as the Telco Customer Churn dataset) which contains:
- **Demographic information** ‚Äî gender, age, location
- **Service details** ‚Äî subscription type, contract duration, services used
- **Account information** ‚Äî tenure, monthly charges, payment method
- **Churn label** ‚Äî indicates whether the customer left (`Yes`/`No`)

> ‚ö† **Note:** Raw data is not committed to this repository due to size and privacy concerns.  
Instead, sample data and instructions to obtain the full dataset are provided.

## üîÑ Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize churn distribution
   - Identify correlations and key drivers of churn

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features from existing ones
   - Select the most relevant features

4. **Model Training**
   - Train baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Compare performance using metrics

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   - Confusion Matrix visualization

6. **Prediction**
   - Predict churn probability for new customers
   - Save and load models for reuse
